Ok, let's try to understand some programming stuff from fundamental aspects

- How compiler works?
    Well, compiler works in 4 basic way;
        1.  preprocessing
        2.  compiling
        3.  assembling 
        4.  linking

- Why /0 appended  in string, especially in C?
    Well, all other data types have distinct memory unit like
    int have 4 bytes
    float have 4 bytes
    but string datatypes memory unit can be different since it can be assigned according the use
    example;
        'aashish' takes 7 bytes of memory
        'ok' takes 2 bytes of memory
    So, it's really hard to determine the ending of string since it doesn't have any definate memory unit
    Therefore, \0 is used to indicate the end of the  string
